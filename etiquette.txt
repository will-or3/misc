1. Knowledge & skill etiquette
	- Gatekeeping excessively --  hoarding information instead of sharing or mentoring
	- Bragging without substance -- claiming exploits or code you didn't discover or understand 
	- Copy/Pasting blindly -- classic script kiddie behavior
	- Posing expertise -- "I hacked X" when you ran a prebuilt tool

2. Communication etiquette
	- Jargon flexing (for no reason) -- unnecessary complicating explanations to intimidate beginners
	- Dismissing Newbies outright -- we all start somewhere; mocking questions instead of answering them
	- Threatening people online -- "I'll put a virus on your computer", "I'll hack your Facebook" or "does this look familiar 192.xxx.xxx"
	- Spamming -- posting exploits or questions repeatedly for attention
	- Ad Hominem -- turning technical discussion into personal attacks

3. Tools etiquette
	- relying solely on GUI or automated tools -- "I used Metasploit/Burp, I'm elite"
	- Messing with Shared resources -- abusing Tor bandwidth, CTF servers, or public labs
	- Refusing to learn fundamentals -- insisting tools are enough and skipping underlying concepts

4. Misc
	- Ignoring responsible disclosure -- leaking before vendors have (reasonable) time to patch
	- Claim-hogging -- taking credit for collaborations or community work
	- Not giving credit -- failing to cite repos, writeups, or contributors you used
	- Misrepresenting risk -- blowing up minor issues for clout

	- calling every piece of malware a virus ಠ_ಠ
